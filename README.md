# Shopping App with Working Shopping Cart #

This is a simple shopping app with a working shopping cart and product sorting. The main goal of this project was to learn how to manage
state in React with functional components.

There's a landing page, shopping area, and cart and checkout page.
Routing between pages is accomplished with React-Router. All styling was recently redone with TailwindCSS and the app itself was scaffolded
using Create-React-App.
